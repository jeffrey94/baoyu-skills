# Funding Societies Style

**Psychological intent**: Cute + Energetic + Trustworthy. Financial education that feels fun, approachable, and share-worthy. The viewer should feel: "This is adorable, easy to understand, and I want to send this to my friend who runs a business."

**Design DNA**: Rotating soft pastel backgrounds (light purple, light yellow, light teal) with bold saturated brand-color accents. A prominent cute character drives engagement — big head, expressive, interacting with content elements. Sticker-like badges, star bursts, and sparkle decorations create energy. Rounded Poppins typography with color-filled highlight markers. Every slide feels like a fun, colorful page from a cute educational guidebook.

## Color System

### Full Saturation (accents, badges, icons, text highlights)
| Color | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| Purple | #5203EA | Headlines, numbered badges, key structural text |
| Yellow | #FFDE0F | Highlight markers, speech bubbles, CTA buttons, star bursts |
| Teal | #27E4CD | Checkmarks, positive indicators, fun accents |
| Blue | #2C50FF | Data/numbers (RM amounts), secondary badges |

### Soft Pastels (rotating slide backgrounds)
| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Light purple | #EDE7FB | Background for slides 1, 4, 7 |
| Light yellow | #FFF9DB | Background for slides 2, 5, 8 |
| Light teal | #E0F9F3 | Background for slides 3, 6 |
| White | #FFFFFF | Content card interiors, contrast zones |

### Text
| Color | Hex | Use |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Near-black | #1A1A1A | Body text |
| Dark purple | #3A0299 | Headlines on light backgrounds |
| White | #FFFFFF | Text on saturated color backgrounds |

**Color rotation creates energy** — each slide feels fresh because the background shifts, but the brand palette stays consistent. This prevents "carousel fatigue."

## Character Design (CORE ENGAGEMENT ELEMENT)

The character is NOT a tiny afterthought — it's a **primary engagement driver**.

### Appearance
- **Big round head** (30-40% of body height) — cute proportions
- **Large expressive eyes** (not dots — round eyes with pupils, can show emotion)
- **Simple nose** (tiny dot or line)
- **Expressive mouth** (smile, frown, O-shape, etc.)
- **Small body** with simple limbs — chibi/SD proportions
- **Yellow (#FFDE0F) tie or scarf** — brand accent on every appearance
- **Outfit**: Simple business casual (shirt, pants) in light gray/white outlines
- **NO realistic proportions** — this is cute, not corporate

### Behavior
- **Interacts with content**: Holds up signs, points at text, hugs oversized objects (giant receipt, huge calculator), climbs on stacks of coins
- **Exaggerated emotions**: Panic sweat drops, heart eyes, sparkle eyes, dizzy spirals, triumphant fist pump
- **Size**: Medium to large (25-35% of slide area) — the character is a FEATURE, not filler
- **Placement**: Varies per slide — sometimes center, sometimes side, sometimes peeking from bottom. NOT always bottom-right.

### Expressions per slide type
- Cover: Panicking/stressed (sweat drops, messy hair)
- Problem: Confused (question marks, tilted head)
- Explanation: Thinking (hand on chin, lightbulb)
- Solution: Excited (sparkle eyes, pointing up)
- List: Organized (holding clipboard, thumbs up)
- Data: Impressed (jaw drop, heart eyes at big number)
- Warning: Scared (hiding behind hands, peeking out)
- CTA: Confident (power pose, big smile, sparkles around)

## Typography System

### Headlines
- **Poppins SemiBold**, large, purple (#5203EA) or dark purple (#3A0299)
- 2-3 key words get **yellow (#FFDE0F) marker highlight** — thick, hand-drawn feel, slightly tilted
- Can use **mixed colors** within headline (purple base + blue for data words)
- ROUNDED feeling — Poppins' natural roundness enhances cuteness

### Callout Numbers / Data
- **Poppins Bold** in blue (#2C50FF) or white-on-purple badge
- Star burst shape behind important numbers (like "RM50,000+")
- Or inside a colored circle badge

### Body Text
- **Inter** regular, near-black (#1A1A1A), well-spaced
- Key phrases in **Inter Bold** or **colored** (purple/blue) for scanability

### Badges & Tags
- **Rounded pill badges**: Saturated brand color background + white text
  - Purple pill: Category labels ("BUCKET 1", "TAX TIP")
  - Yellow pill: Urgency ("NEW!", "IMPORTANT!")
  - Teal pill: Positive ("SAVE THIS!", "CORRECT")
- **Circle number badges**: Purple circle with white number for lists
- **Sticker tags**: Slightly tilted, with soft shadow — feels pasted on

### Speech Bubbles
- **Yellow-filled (#FFDE0F)** rounded rectangle with tail
- Near-black Inter text inside
- Slightly tilted (2-5 degrees) for playful energy
- Can have small sparkle/star decorations nearby

## Decorative Elements (Repeating System)

These create the "cute + energetic" feeling:

1. **Sparkles/stars** ✨ — small 4-point stars scattered near important elements (2-3 per slide, in yellow or teal)
2. **Confetti dots** — tiny colored circles (purple, yellow, teal) scattered lightly in background corners
3. **Arrow doodles** — bouncy, hand-drawn style arrows pointing to key info (in purple or teal)
4. **Exclamation marks** — bold, colorful, near surprising facts
5. **Star burst shapes** — behind key numbers or callouts (yellow fill, creates "POW!" energy)
6. **Soft shadows** — on cards, badges, and character (creates depth and tactile feel)
7. **Slight tilts** — badges, speech bubbles, and some text elements tilted 2-5 degrees (breaks grid rigidity)

## Slide Structure

### Cover Slide
- Light purple (#EDE7FB) pastel background
- LARGE purple headline with yellow highlights
- Character LARGE and centered — in panicking/curious pose
- Yellow speech bubble with hook question
- Sparkles and confetti dots scattered
- Keep top-left corner unobstructed (no text/elements there) — logo will be overlaid in post-production. Background should flow naturally through that area.

### Content Slides
- Rotating pastel backgrounds (yellow, teal, purple)
- Purple pill badge at top for category label
- White rounded card for main content (with soft shadow)
- Inside card: headline + body text + visual (diagram, icons, etc.)
- Character at medium size, interacting with the content
- Sparkles near key points
- Teal or yellow decorative accents

### List Slides
- Pastel background
- Items with colored circle number badges (purple) or teal checkmarks
- Each item in a white rounded row/strip with soft shadow
- Data in blue (#2C50FF) stands out
- Character reacting to the list (impressed, organized)

### Warning Slide
- Light yellow (#FFF9DB) background (yellow = caution energy)
- Items with red X marks inside soft rounded containers
- Character in worried/scared pose (peeking from behind something)
- Star burst behind penalty amounts

### CTA / Finale Slide
- Split: top pastel, bottom saturated purple (#5203EA)
- Action items with teal checkmarks on top
- Character in confident power pose with sparkles
- Yellow pill CTA button on purple section
- Maximum sparkle/confetti energy — celebratory!

## What Makes This Style Shareable

1. **Cute character** = people share cute things. "Omg this little guy is so relatable"
2. **Rotating colors** = each slide feels fresh, no carousel fatigue
3. **Star bursts on numbers** = RM50K+ pops → "wait, really?!" → save
4. **Sparkles + confetti** = feels celebratory and positive, not dry
5. **Yellow highlights** = eyes go straight to key takeaway
6. **Sticker badges** = feels like a fun guidebook, not a corporate memo
7. **Character interactions** = creates narrative arc (stressed → confident) → emotional hook
